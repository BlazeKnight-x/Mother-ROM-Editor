*Brother!
 I'm so scared!
\b My lamp suddenly
 started going crazy!

0002 # 
*Brother! It's like
 our house is about to
 fall apart!

0003 # 
*Waah!

0004 # 
*Here's some juice,
 big brother!

0005 # 


0006 # 
*Whew, that was scary.
\b*Oh! I think I see
 something inside the
 doll!

0008 # 
*I'm Mimmie.
 Don't mix me up with
 Minnie!

0009 # 
*Are you okay,
 [ninten]?
\b*What on earth is
 happening to our
 home?
\b I'm so scared...
\b*If only your father
 were here now...

000a # 
*You're much braver
 than I ever imagined.
\b*...But I can't send
 you on a journey so
 famished.

000b # 
*Oh, my! You're hurt!

000c # 
*Let's see... To get
 to the next level,
 you need...

000d # 
*Come back home
 whenever you want
 more [fav food].

000e # 
*Hmm, I see.
\b Sounds like it must
 be a poltergeist of
 some sort.
\b*I'm not sure what to
 do about it, either.
\b*But your great-
 grandfather did study
 PSI at one point.
\b*Perhaps there's
 something in the
 basement that could
\b help make sense of
 things.
\b*I know I put the
 basement key
 somewhere...
\b but I can't remember
 where.
\b*Anyway, you're our
 only hope.
\b Now is the time for
 an adventure.
\b Go forth, [ninten]!
 Protect us all!

0013 # 
*(Click! Beep-beep-
 beep...)

0014 # 
*[ninten]?
 It's your dad.

0015 # 
*I've deposited $%%t

0016 # 
*I realize this isn't
 any of my business,
\b but why don't you
 take a little break?

0017 # 
*I see. Then I'll
 make a record of
 your progress.

0018 # 
*I see. Well, I guess
 the Earth IS in
 danger and all.

001b # 
*Okay.
\b*Your dear old dad was
 also thinking about
\b hitting the hay for
 the night.
\b*I've created a record
 of your adventure to
 this point.
\b*Good night, sleep
 tight.

001c # 
*We're a great team,
 aren't we?
\b*Well, you should turn
 the power OFF now.
\b*All right?

001d # 
*[ninten], you like to
 work hard, just like
 your mom.
\b*But, I don't think
 it's good to work too
 hard.

001e # 
*Anyway, what do you
 need from me?

0021 # 
*Good luck!

0023 # 
*Hello.
\b Pippi and I are
 feeling just dandy
 now!

0024 # 
*You didn't come from
 the cemetery to the
 south, did you?
\b Please tell me you
 didn't!

0025 # 
*You're really
 amazing.

0026 # 
*Please tell me you're
 not a zombie!
\b ...Are you?

0027 # 
*Oh, yeah? W-w-well...
\b You're a big stupid
 zombie head! Waaaah!
 Eek!

0028 # 
*Are you really a
 human?

0029 # 
*I'm amazed you made
 it this far.

002a # 
*I knew it...

002b # 
*I'm so scared I'm
 about to wet my
 pants...

002c # 
*Boy, that was
 scary...

002d # 
*ZOMBIE!

002e # 
*Heheheh...!
 You get to be a
 zombie too!

002f # 
*There must be someone
 controlling the
 dead...

0030 # 
*Not too shabby,
 youngster!

0031 # 
*Are the zombies going
 to take over our town
 too?

0032 # 
*Oh, that's a baby
 canary.
\b Did you find it in
 Canary Village?

0033 # 
*Hmm. You don't say.

0034 # 
*The birds of Canary
 Village do sing such
 lovely songs.

0035 # 
*I really admire the
 man living in Canary
 Village.

0036 # 
*The town mayor is
 looking for someone
 brave to help him.

0037 # 
*I heard a little girl
 got lost in the
 cemetery.
\b I wonder if she's
 been rescued yet...

0038 # 
*Say... You're not
 honestly thinking of
\b going to the
 cemetery, are you?

0039 # 
*I thought you were
 a sensible boy.

003a # 
*Animals have suddenly
 turned violent,
\b and the dead have
 come back as zombies
 to attack us...
\b*What are we supposed
 to do?
\b I'm so scared I can
 hardly breathe...
 (gasp gasp)

003b # 
*You're so awesome!

003d # 
*Did a poltergeist
 attack your house?
\b It tore mine apart.

003e # 
*I hear they locked
 the zoo up to keep
\b any more animals from
 escaping.
\b*They've all gone
 berserk, you see...

003f # 
*Bread is great for
 when you're hungry,
\b but I bet you could
 also use its crumbs
 to mark your trail.
\b*...I guess it's
 really none of my
 business, though.

0040 # 
*I don't know,
\b this task might be
 too much for you to
 handle,
\b but I still have high
 hopes for you anyway.

0041 # 
*Well, you see...
\b*A child has strayed
 into the cemetery.
\b*And, as luck would
 have it, I'm up for
 re-election soon.
\b*So... please help me!

0042 # 
*Oh! You'll do it?!
\b*You'll go and rescue
 her?!

0043 # 
*Oh, is this Pippi,
 the girl who got
 lost?
\b*Stunning work, lad!
\b*I knew from the start
 that you showed
 promise!
\b (clap clap applause)
\b*You're so lucky,
 Pippi.
 Adorable, too.
\b*Now remember to tell
 your mother that the
 mayor rescued you.
\b*And for you,
 [leader's name]...
 A $%%
0046 # 
*Say, since you're
 here and everything,
\b won't you help with
 the zoo problem too?

0047 # 
*Oh, you'll go check
 it out?
 That's wonderful!
\b [leader's name],
 you certainly do love
 to play games!
\b*Have my assistant
 Abbot give you a key
 to the zoo.

0048 # 
*Here you go. This is
 the key to the zoo.

0049 # 
*Come back alive and
 you'll be a hero!
\b*I'd go with you, but
 I'm, umm, not feeling
 well...

004a # 
*Oh, it's [leader's name], the
 hero!
\b*You have tiger
 droppings all over
 your clothes, y'know.
\b*Oh, I'm just kidding!
\b*Sorry, I don't have
 anything to give you
 this time...
\b Wahahaha!

004b # 
*Everyone's talking
 about a girl with
 special powers.
\b Have you heard about
 her?
\b*I bet she'd be a
 great help to you on
 your journey.

004c # 
*I have plenty of
 extra zoo keys.
\b*Here, have another.

004d # 
*As you can see, all
 our animals have
 escaped.

004e # 
*All we have left is
 this canary chick.
\b Interested in buying
 it?

004f # 
*Then how about for
 $%%
0050 # 
*Yeah, I don't blame
 you.
\b It doesn't even know
 any songs.

0051 # 
*Thanks! Take extra
 good care of it!

0052 # 
*How about for free,
 then? C'mon, take it.

0053 # 
*Say, how's that
 canary doing?

0054 # 
*I'm almost certain
 that something is
\b controlling all the
 animals...

0055 # 
*Animals are so cute.
 Don't you agree?

0056 # 
*Teehee.

0057 # 
*Stupid head!

0058 # 
*Se\ll somethin' wi\ll ya!

0059 # 
*Something is speaking
 into [leader's name]'s mind.

005a # 
*Whew, what a relief.

005b # 
*Thanks! (giggle)
005c # 
*It's nice that
 there's a machine
\b on the first floor of
 the department store
 that lets you
\b withdraw cash from
 your bank account,
\b but you need a PTA
 card or something to
 use it.
\b That's not very
 convenient, if you
 ask me.

005e # 
*It's such nice
 weather out.
\b But what does it
 matter?

005f # 
*Oh, that canary is
 Laura the songbird's
 baby!
\b*Go take it to her!

0060 # 
*You seem to have
 forgotten something
 important about life.
\b How sad.

0061 # 
*Now where did I last
 see Laura...?

0062 # 
*It sounds like Laura
 the songbird has
 remembered her song.
\b*Have you learned her
 melody, too?

0063 # 
*Well, that's no good.

0064 # 
*In song there is
 strength.
\b True words, indeed.

0065 # 
*I'm Pippi. I'm lost.
 You're really brave,
 huh?

0066 # 
*You're such a
 goofball! Hahaha!

0067 # 
*You're really brave.
 I hope we meet again
 sometime, don't you?

0068 # 
*Oh, I'm so happy!
\b*Here, this badge can
 be a symbol of our
 bond.
\b Take it with you.

0069 # 
*I guess you already
 have a special
 someone, huh...

006a # 
*Well, I guess this is
 bye for now.
\b*Come by my house
 later to pick up an
 item of mine.
\b*By the way... do you
 think my socks are
 too short?

006c # 
*Oh, you didn't have
 to answer.
\b You're such a
 cutie...

006d # 
*Kyakyakya!
 (You're a big doo-doo
 head!)

006e # 
*[leader's name] heard a
 voice...
\b*"Where is the god's
 tail?"

006f # 
*Whoa, those are some
 weird clothes you
 have on there.
\b*I bet you'll attract
 monsters dressed like
 that!

0071 # 
*Happiness won't just
 walk into your life
 on its own.
\b*But neither will
 unhappiness.
\b*Wouldn't you agree?

0072 # 
*So if you don't want
 trouble in your
 life...
\b then you'd best stay
 still and never move
 a muscle.

0073 # 
*Really? Unhappiness
 CAN walk?
\b I had no idea.

0074 # 
*So, you admit I have
 good taste?
\b*Then I take it you
 want a cool nickname,
 too?

0075 # 
*Okay, I got it.
\b*From now on, your
 name will be Stupid
 Face [leader's name].
\b*It just oozes class.

0076 # 
*Oh, that's too bad.

0077 # 
*Heya, Stupid Face
 [leader's name]!

0078 # 
*Have you met the guy
 who philosophizes
 about happiness?

0079 # 
*He's a master
 nicknamer. He's got a
 real knack for names.

007a # 
*People cannot part if
 they have not yet
 met.

007b # 
*Have you met a guy
 who talks about how
\b you can't part if you
 haven't met?

007c # 
*I agree with him,
 actually.

007d # 
*You really should
 meet him. You'll be a
 better person for it!

007e # 
*I feel completely
 refreshed after
\b stopping by Queen
 Mary's fountain!

007f # 
*Getting to Queen
 Mary's fountain is
 really tough.
\b Not only is it far
 away, but it's hard
 to find, too.

0080 # 
*I'm going to take
 this broken earring
 to the fountain
\b to turn it into a
 magic earring.

0081 # 
*I feel so relaxed
 just listening to the
\b mysterious sound of
 the fountain.

0082 # 
*Oh, are you lost?
 Just keep going
 south.
\b*Oops, sorry.
\b I thought you were
 looking for a
 restroom.
\b*If you're looking for
 Queen Mary's
 fountain,
\b then just go west
 from the castle.

0084 # 
*I bent my spoon, and
 now it's hard to eat
 with.
\b*Can you bend it back
 for me?

0085 # 
*Please hurry.
\b*([ninten] used the
 power of PSI to fix
 the spoon.)
\b*Thanks!
 (munch munch chomp
 chomp)
\b*Do you wanna stay the
 night here tonight?

0086 # 
*Why not?!

0087 # 
*You're very strange,
 you know that?
\b But I also think I
 might like you...

0088 # 
*Great!

0089 # 
*Waaah! You're
 supposed to accept
 people's kindness!

008a # 
*Oh, a traveler!
 Why don't you eat
 with us?
\b*Here, can you guess
 what we're having
 today?

008b # 
*Huh? Why can't you
 tell? You're really
 suspicious!

008c # 
*That's right,
 [fav food].
\b*I read your mind and
 decided to make
 [fav food].
\b*How does it taste?
 Do you like it?

008f # 
*I used to run a
 musical instrument
 store,
\b but the ocarina I
 ordered never
 arrived.
\b*So I've given up.

0090 # 
*Oh. I see.

0091 # 
*Thanks!
\b*Your bed is ready.
 Pleasant dreams!

0092 # 
*Stop by again
 anytime!

0093 # 
*You don't fit in with
 this place, you know
 that?

0094 # 
*I finished the
 Ocarina of Hope.
\b*It can play the
 melodies that you
 know.
\b*Do you want it?

0096 # 
*Ahahaha. You're a
 real straightforward
 guy.
\b*Here you go.

0097 # 
*Ahahaha! "I want it!"
 is written all over
 your face.
\b*Go ahead, take it
 with you.

0098 # 
*Hi, kid!
 How's it going?

0099 # 
*Leave Magicant?
 That'd be the day!
\b*Ahahaha!

009a # 
*Outside?
\b What is this
 "outside" you speak
 of?

009b # 
*I'm so embarrassed I
 wish I could crawl
 into a hole.
\b*If only there were
 holes to crawl
 into...

009c # 
*I'm the goods-keeper.
 Want help?

009d # 
*I'm great at
 impressions, you
 know!

009e # 
*There's a whole bunch
 of holes east of
 town.
\b*I'm not sure which
 hole it is,
\b but you can hear
 otherworldly sounds
 coming from one.

00a1 # 
*If you pull out a
 Red Weed and put it
 in the fountain,
\b it'll turn into a
 Magic Herb... just
 like magic!

00a2 # 
*Could I interest you
 in a Big Bag?

00a3 # 
*In that case,
\b could I borrow your
 ATM Card for a short
 while?

00a4 # 
*It has 30 Magic Herbs
 inside it, in case
 you didn't know.

00a5 # 
*Thanks. I promise
 I'll give it back.
\b*It just seems...
 really cool.

00a6 # 
*You don't trust
 others.
\b*That might be for the
 best. Well, maybe...

00a7 # 
*Oh, right, I need to
 return your ATM Card.

00a8 # 
*The queen isn't
 feeling very well
 right now...

00a9 # 
*You look suspicious.
\b*But I'll let you
 through if you can
\b solve my little
 riddle...

00aa # 
*That's right.
 The answer is
 "two alligators".
\b*I haven't thought up
 the question yet,
 though.
\b Heheh.

00ab # 
*Take care!

00ad # 
*I wish I could hear
 the queen's song
 again...

00ae # 
*Oh, hello!
\b*I was just in the
 middle of pondering
\b philosophical
 questions.
\b*It's hard for me to
 focus with all this
 guitar music, though.
\b*Oh! Whoops!
\b I didn't realize I
 was the one playing
 the guitar!
\b How careless of me!
\b*.........
\b*This is a secret
 between just you and
 me:
\b come back here when
 you're stronger.
\b*You should probably
 make a note of this
 now so you don't
\b forget later.

00b0 # 
*You tried to ignore
 me, didn't you?
\b*I get so lonely,
 being out here all by
 myself.
\b*If there's anything I
 can do, I'll do it.
\b*Here!

00b1 # 
*I'm so happy you
 came!
\b*I know just what you
 want.
\b*Here you go!

00b2 # 
*I finally wrote a
 song!
\b Give it a listen,
 you music-loving
 adventurer!
\b*Oh, baby doll, why do
 you weep?
\b The saddened canary
 won't utter a peep.
\b The monkey can sing,
 the piano - it
 chimes.
\b Though ghosts will
 play out on its
 keyboard sometimes.
\b Each night in the
 desert, the lone
 cactus croons.
\b The dragon, when
 beaten, will carry
 some tunes.
\b While scaling the
 mountain, EVE sings
 along.
\b Will Queen Mary ever
 hear the XX Stone's
 last song?
\b Lalala, what a
 mysterious lullaby.
\b Lullaby, bye-bye, and
 goodbye.
\b*What do you think?
 Nice song, huh?
\b*It is, isn't it?

00b3 # 
*Deep in the forest is
 a guitar player who
 loves solitude.
\b*He's kind of
 handsome... and a
 great poet, too.

00b4 # 
*I've heard about a
 man who was
 forgotten...
\b*But I forget what his
 story was.

00b5 # 
*Though you may not
 believe it, I'm a
 healer.
\b*I can restore your
 PP or heal friends
 turned to stone.
\b*So, what can I do
 for you?

00b6 # 
*...That's what I
 figured.

00b7 # 
*Don't carry so much
 cash with you.
\b*Go think things
 over. See you later.

00b8 # 
*I'm an unsinging
 monkey.
\b*But monkeys don't
 normally sing,
 anyway.
\b*Any questions?

00b9 # 
*I'm sure it's a dumb
 question, too.

00ba # 
*Whew, what a relief.
\b*I was worried you
 were going to ask me
 something tough.
\b*Say, you look kind of
 like Queen Mary.
\b*I wonder why that is.

00bb # 
*I wanted to tell you
 this as soon as I saw
 you...
\b*The train tracks have
 been fixed,
\b so the train can run
 through here again.

00bc # 
*Just once, I'd like
 to go inside the
 castle and see what
\b Queen Mary looks
 like.

00bd # 
*Queen Mary often has
 nightmares.
\b*She talks like she's
 punishing a naughty
 child
\b and then cries out
 about being afraid.
\b*Then she starts to
 sing a song, but only
 a short bit of it.
\b*The fact she can't
 remember it seems to
 bring her pain.
\b*Then she wakes up
 covered in sweat.
\b*Something really sad
 must've happened
\b to Queen Mary a long
 time ago...

00be # 
*But it's for girls
 only.

00bf # 
*Zzzzz...

00c1 # 
*You rotten liar!

00c2 # 
*We all know you're
 not from here,
\b but we consider you
 one of us just the
 same.
\b*With the Onyx Hook,
 you can come back
 here any time.

00c3 # 
*Don't hesitate to
 come visit us again
\b whenever you're
 having a hard time.
\b*Everyone here loves
 you.

00c4 # 
*Welcome, [leader's name].
\b*Here in the land of
 Magicant, everyone is
 your friend
\b and you can have as
 much as you like of
 whatever you want.
\b*Oh? You want to hear
 my song?
\b*I'm sorry. I don't
 know why,
\b but I just can't seem
 to remember it.
\b*I'm sure I'll be able
 to remember it
 someday...
\b*If I can just sing it
 again, something will
 happen...
\b I just know it.

00ca # 
*......

00cb # 
*Let me hear the
 melodies you've
 learned...

00cc # 
*Yes... That's it...
 That's the song...

00cd # 
*Oh... Giygas...

00cf # 
*I had a dream that
 Magicant vanished
 into thin air.
\b*My heart's still
 pounding, even now.

00d1 # 
*I'm a cat that swims
 in the ground.
\b*Can you guess what
 I'm holding in my
 paw?

00d2 # 
*Did you see what I'm
 holding in my paw?
\b*That's right.
 A ribbon.
\b*This ribbon is
 overflowing with a
 special power.

00d3 # 
*I'll only give this
 Magic Ribbon to a
 girl.

00d4 # 
*I'm a swimming cat.
\b*Have you heard of a
 candy that gives
 courage and strength
 to weaklings?

00d5 # 
*I see. But you're a
 strong boy,
\b so I doubt you would
 need any.

00d6 # 
*That boy with the
 glasses seems pretty
 weak.
\b I'll give the candy
 to him.

00d8 # 
*Pretty tasty candy,
 huh?

00d9 # 
*If you need to see
 the helpful old man,
\b go to Queen Mary's
 Fountain.
\b*He'll come if he
 hears a cry from the
 heart.
\b*Remember, a cry from
 the heart!

00db # 
*(The crowd grows
 restless.)
\b*We didn't come to see
 no lousy rocks with
 hats on 'em!
\b Boo! Boo!

00dc # 
*Need something?

00dd # 
*Oh, okay. Goodbye.

00de # 
*Do you need money?

00df # 
*How is it? Are you
 finding it helpful?

00e0 # 
*I see.
\b*You have $%<current balance>.

00e1 # 
*Hocus-pocus,
 allakazam!
\b*Use it wisely.
 Goodbye.

00e2 # 
*You can't withdraw
 that much.
\b*You'll have to try
 again. Goodbye.

00e3 # 
*I'm a forgotten man.
 I might as well not
 exist.
\b*You didn't have to
 notice me, you
 know...
\b*Just go ahead and
 ignore me.

00e4 # 
*I'm a nowhere man.
\b*It's best if you
 don't give me words
 of kindness.
\b*I can't live on like
 this if I start to
 miss people...

00e5 # 
*My conversations are
 always a monologue.
\b*I've always been
 alone, from the
 moment I was born.

00e6 # 
*Good luck, bad
 luck...
\b None of it makes a
 difference to me.
\b*Sometimes just
 breathing is almost
\b too much for me to
 handle.

00e7 # 
*Why do you insist on
 talking to me?
\b*Are you a forgotten
 man, too?

00e8 # 
*Liar! I know there's
 a girl waiting for
 you!
\b Just leave me alone
 and go back to her!

00e9 # 
*Yeah. That's what I
 figured. Yep.
\b*Now just hurry and
 ignore me already.

00ea # 
*Good. Thanks.

00eb # 
*You seem to be
 holding too much
 stuff.
\b*Come back for it
 later.

00ec # 
*I heard some really
 weird stuff is
\b happening over in
 Mother's Day...?

00ed # 
*Something about a
 kidnapped zombie
\b and animals doing
 something or other...
\b It sounds absolutely
 nuts.

 Welcome to the town

\b*I suggest you use the
 bridge to the east of
 the zoo instead.

00f6 # 
*Hey, why aren't you
 in school, kid?
\b*I'm pretty sure
 today's a school day.

\b*You swiped it, didn't
 you?

*Some really strong
 monsters beat me up.
\b*If you're headed for
 the train station,
\b I'd watch out if I
 were you...

00fd # 
*I heard they lifted
 the order for martial
 law in Mother's Day.
\b*Which means we can
 cross that bridge
 now...
\b*Get my drift?

0100 # 
*I was teasing that
 wimp [lloyd] just
 now, but he got away.

 stinkling [lloyd]!

0102 #

 on that weakling
 [lloyd], haven't you?

0103 # 
*What?! That was just
 a joke?!

0104 # 
*I heard that [lloyd]
 ran off with some
 explosives.
\b*He's in big trouble
 if a teacher finds
 him...

0105 # 
*[lloyd]. Your glasses
 are slipping.

 pretty?

0107 #

\b*Stupid Face is what
 they should call you!

 ditch class and
\b listen to the radio
 on the roof, too!
\b Weren't you?!

010a # 
*Geez, you don't talk
 much, do you?

010b # 
*The gym teacher hit
 me.
\b*Maybe I should drop
 out and become a
 thug...

010c # 
*Getting lost in your
 own school...
\b*Can you get any more
 lame?!

010d #

 roof is locked?

010f # 
*All she does is get
 fatter and fatter.
\b*Isn't she a terrible
 woman?

0110 #

 wouldn't understand
\b the sorrows of
 life...

 about my wife like
 that!
\b*Get out!

0112 # 
*She was pretty when
 she was young.
\b*Yeah, come to think
 of it, she has her
 good points, too.
\b*Say, how about some
 tea?

0114 # 
*You're a pretty smart
 kid.
\b*Oh, that's right, you
 want to go up to the
 roof.
\b*All right, then.
 Follow me.

*Hold on. What are you
 doing with something
 as dangerous as that?
\b*I think I'LL hold on
 to this for you.

 a while and have some
 tea.

0118 # 
*No running in the
 halls!

0119 # 
*Hey! I haven't seen
 you before, kid!
\b*Do you even go to
 this school?

011a # 
*Oh, okay. Just don't
 run in the halls.

011b # 
*Show me what you
 have.
\b*You better not be
 carrying anything
 dangerous...

011d # 
*Who's there?!
\b*I'm not coming out!
\b*You're just gonna
 pick on me if I do!

011e # 
*You want to be my
 friend?!
\b*Then do you promise
 not to tell that I
 took explosives
\b from the science lab?

011f # 
*I'm coming out now.

0120 # 
*I'm [lloyd].
\b*I heard they make
 Pencil Rockets at the
\b Sweet Little Factory
 south of here...
\b I wanna launch one
 really bad!

0121 # 
*You must be
 exhausted. You should
 stay the night!

0123 # 
*Wow!
\b*So this is a Pencil
 Rocket! I heard so
 much about them!
\b*I should be able to
 make more of these
 now.
\b*Come with me to the
 science lab.

0124 # 
*You flipped the
 switch on the rocket.

0125 # 
*[lloyd]: I may be a
 wimp, but now it's my
 turn to fight!
\b*[teddy]! You can take
 it easy in here.

0126 # 
*I'm a weird teacher
 who secretly lives in
 this school.
\b Yes, I admit I'm
 weird.
\b*I need funding for my
 research.
\b*Would you be willing
 to buy one of my
 inventions?

0128 # 
*Then have a look at
 my goods.

0129 # 
*Come on, you gotta
 have at least SOME
 allowance money...

012b # 
*Come back anytime.
\b*I'll have some more
 nice stuff ready for
 you.

012c # 
*I haven't made any
 progress with my
\b inventions since your
 last visit.
\b*Would you like to see
 my older items?

012d # 
*I heard on the radio
 just now that major
\b panics are breaking
 out everywhere.
\b*I WILL protect this
 train station, no
 matter what!

012f # 
*I can't guarantee
 this train'll go very
 far,
\b but you'll still need
 to pay.
\b*Are you gonna ride
 the train?

0130 # 
*([leader's name]'s weapon
 was confiscated.)

0134 # 
*That'll be $%%
0137 # 
*It looks like that
 hat you have belongs
\b to a girl named
 [ana] in Snowman.
\b*You should go and
 return it to her.

0138 # 
*May you live a long
 life.

0139 # 
*I was on my way to
 the town of Easter to
 find my wife.
\b*But with the train
 tracks busted,
\b I have no way to get
 there now...

013a # 
*Poking your nose into
 other people's
 business
\b is what makes playing
 games so fun!

013c # 
*Here you go.

013d # 
*Have you seen a man
 with a sinister
 mustache?

013e # 
*Sounds like he got
 away.
\b*Guess I'll just go
 and catch me some
\b more parking
 violators then.

013f # 
*He's a big-time scam
 artist.
\b*If you see him, let
 me know immediately!

0140 # 
*Whoa, hey, kid!
\b Hold on to this money
 for me, will ya?
\b*If you run into any
 cops, act like you
 never saw me.

0141 # 
*Don't run off with
 it, now!

0142 # 
*You'll do what I say!

0143 # 
*Quit bugging me!
\b I'm trying to make a
 getaway here!

0144 # 
*Have you seen a man
 with a huge gut?

0145 # 
*Looks like he got
 away.
\b*Guess I'll just go
 and catch some
 speeders then...

0146 # 
*He ate five orders of
 [fav food]
\b and then ran off
 without paying.
\b*If you see him, let
 me know immediately!

0147 # 
*Oof, my stomach's so
 full. (belch)

0148 # 
*Things've gotten
 mighty dangerous in
 this town.
\b*But it's still a
 whole lot better
\b than the city of
 Valentine, that's for
 sure.

0149 # 
*Oh, yeah!!
 You feelin' it?!

014a # 
*Right on!
\b You wanna hear me
 sing?!

014b # 
*I'm feelin' glum.

014c # 
*It's time to say
 goodbye already?

014e # 
*Have you heard the
 dragon's lullaby?

014f # 
*I heard that there's
 a h-h-haunted house
\b in the town of
 Halloween.
\b*I dunno about you,
\b but I'd never go
 anywhere near that
 place!

0151 # 
*Give me something.
 Anything.
\b*Gimme.
\b*Please.
\b*Pretty please?

0152 # 
*I'll give you
 something in return,
 of course.

0153 # 
*I was gonna give you
 something good in
 return, too...

0154 # 
*What will you give
 me?

0155 # 
*Thanks. In return,
 here are some fleas
 and lice.
\b*Take them with you.

0156 # 
*A cold's been going
 around lately...
\b*Achoo!
\b*Argh! This sucks!

0157 # 
*I heard there's a
 prophetic old man in
 the mountains
\b who's lived for 300
 years without ever
 catching a cold.

0158 # 
*A aann aak eey ell
 iiow ma ennas.

0159 # 
*Not even I can hold a
 normal conversation
 with him like this...

015a # 
*Oh! In exchange for
 finding my dentures,
\b I'll share with you
 my secret to living a
 long life.
\b*And that secret is...
\b ...to gargle all the
 time.
\b*If you catch a cold,
 go and gargle until
 it's gone.
\b*Here. Take some of my
 special mouthwash
 with you.

015c # 
*Want more mouthwash?
 It costs %%
015d # 
*I've heard that some
 people have died from
 catching a cold.
\b Just a cold!

015e # 
*Have you heard about
 Halloween's haunted
 house?

015f # 
*They say you can hear
 a piano melody coming
 from inside,
\b even though the house
 is empty.

0160 # 
*In that case, it's
 best that you don't
 know.

0161 # 
*Heh heh heh heh.

0162 # 
*No one's home.
 Keeheehee...

0163 # 
*This is a nightmare.
\b*A bad dream you'll
 never, ever wake
 from...
\b*Hee hee hee...

*G O  B A C K

0165 # 
*Gyaaaa!

0166 # 
*[leader's name].
\b*You're going to die.
\b*Heeheehee hehehe!
\b ...Keeheeheehee!

0167 # 
*A suspicious rat...
 I am not.
\b*The room with the
 piano...
\b*Heheheh...!

0168 # 
*The haunted house
 belongs to the
 Rosemarys.

0169 # 
*A ghost started
 showing up at my
 house, too.
\b*It finally left
 'cause it hated how
 cramped it was.

016a # 
*I'm more like a game
 assistant than a
 citizen of this town.
\b*Surely there are
 things you've
\b forgotten to jot down
 notes about, right?
\b*I can give you a hint
 for $%%
016c # 
*Oh. You're really
 confident about
 yourself.
\b*Then I'll make sure
 we never meet again.

016d # 
*I can give you up to
 three hints.
\b*Everything else is a
 S-E-C-R-E-T.

016e # 
*I'm the most upbeat
 person here in
 Halloween.
\b*Everyone else seems
 so gloomy, wouldn't
 you say?

016f # 
*Yeah, huh.
\b*To be honest, I'm not
 that cheerful a
 person either...

0170 # 
*I dunno.
\b*Maybe I'M actually
 the gloomy one.

0171 # 
*Our home turned into
 a hive for ghosts and
 monsters...
\b*So now we live out
 here.

0172 # 
*[lloyd]: I can use
 the fuel from your
 rocket and...
\b Then, if I use it
 with this...
\b*Pretty cool, huh?
\b Ahh!

0174 # 
*It's too dark to see
 much,
\b but aren't you that
 girl from the church
 in Snowman?
\b*[ana], was it?
\b*Your mom is being
 held in a room in the
 back.
\b*But you can't save us
 right now.
\b*You gotta find a way
 to deal with the
 mothership first...

0175 # 
*Oh! It flew off into
 outer space.
\b*A great success...
 sort of.

0176 # 
*Oh! You're such a
 charming boy!
\b*Why, I could just
 gaze at you
 forever...
\b*If anyone can turn
 our mansion back to
 normal,
\b I'm sure it's you.
\b*Here. This is the key
 to get in.
\b (giggle)

0177 # 
*My name is [ninten].
\b*It used to be
 Bugerror Rosemary,
 though.

0178 # 
*[ninten]! You big
 dummy!
\b*Oh, sorry, I was
 talking to my son,
 not you.

0179 # 
*The ghosts haven't
 quite left yet,
\b but you're such a
 brave boy!
\b*In fact, I even
 renamed my son after
 you.

017a # 
*This is Snowman
 Station, the last
 stop.

017b # 
*I heard all the
 citizens of Easter
 were spirited away.

017c # 
*My mommy's in the
 town of Easter.
\b*We haven't heard from
 her in days,
\b so Daddy and I are
 going there to look
 for her.

017d # 
*Have you been to the
 haunted house in
 Halloween?

017e # 
*You HAVE to tell me
 all about it
 sometime.
\b*I just love scary
 stories!

017f # 
*I don't wanna visit
 it, but you probably
 should.

0180 # 
*It's freezing here in
 Snowman.
\b Be careful not to
 catch a cold.
\b*And be sure to brush
 your teeth, too.
\b*(cough cough)

0182 # 
*Life is a game.
\b*Sometimes it's
 important to rest
\b and pick up where you
 left off later.

0183 # 
*[ana] hasn't been
 at school lately.
\b I'm really worried.

0184 # 
*I'm so worried about
 [ana] that I can't
 sleep at night.

0186 # 
*You don't have enough
 money.

0187 # 
*Oh, my! Your nose is
 running!

0188 # 
*Say, could I speak to
 the person playing
 this game?

0189 # 
*It's really
 important.

018a # 
*Hello, this is
 [ninten]'s father.
\b Thank you for always
 looking after him.
\b*I thought it would be
 nice to at least know
 your name.
\b*So, if you could tell
 me, that'd be great.

018b # 
*Thank you for your
 time.
\b*I'm a busy man
 myself, so I must be
 going now. Goodbye!

018c # 
*[leader's name]... right?

018d # 
*Come on, quit joking
 around.

018e # 
*I've been waiting for
 you.
\b*I need your help to
 find my mom.
\b*Let's start by seeing
 what's happening in
 the town of Easter.

018f # 
*You know, I had a
 dream about someone
\b who looked just like
 you...

0190 # 
*[ninten]...
 Please stay with me.

0191 # 
*No! Stay with me...
\b Please...

0192 # 
*It's so quiet here.
\b*Would you like to
 dance?

0193 # 
*...You're right.
 This isn't the time
 for that.
\b I'm sorry for asking.

0194 # 
*[ninten]...
\b*Do you like me?

0195 # 
*What's wrong,
 [lloyd]?

0196 # 
*The dragon is asleep.
\b*[leader's name] can't wake it
 up just yet.

0197 # 
*The dragon sensed
 [leader's name]'s presence
 and awoke.
\b*"NO ONE WEAKER THAN
 ME CAN HAVE THIS
 SHEET MUSIC."

0199 # 
*My daughter [ana]
 is timid,
\b but she has a kind
 heart and mysterious
 power.

019a # 
*You children WILL be
 victorious.
\b*I have faith that our
 prayers will be heard
 soon.
\b*For now, get some
 rest.

019b # 
*[leader's name] found a pass
 that someone dropped.

019c # 
*[leader's name]'s party
 climbed into the
 rocket.

019d # 
*My grandpa lives in
 the Advent Desert.
\b*If you see him, tell
 him I say hi.

019e # 
*I'm a nice guy's
 corpse.
\b*So don't worry, I
 won't attack you or
 anything like that.

019f # 
*I make a useful
 signpost,
 wouldn't you say?

01a0 # 
*You're one gutsy kid,
 talking to dead
 bodies...

01a1 # 
*I'm a camel's bones.
\b*Would you like some
 tips for walking
 through the desert?

01a2 # 
*Move your left foot
 before your right
 foot sinks.
\b*Move your right foot
 before your left foot
 sinks.
\b*It took me 100 years
 to figure this out.

01a3 # 
*Oh, but I wanna tell
 you.
\b*Wouldn't you like to
 know?

01a4 # 
*Advent Desert is the
 most boring part of
 this game.
\b*But watch out for
 land mines...

01a5 # 
 "Advent Desert"
 Why not take a
 sightseeing flight?

01a6 # 
*I laid land mines in
 this desert during
 the war before last.
\b*I thought I dug 'em
 all up,
\b but I just can't seem
 to find the last one.
\b*Best be careful out
 there.

01a7 # 
*Oh, do you want to
 ride in my plane?

01a8 # 
*Then it'll cost
 $%%
01a9 # 
*It IS rather pricey,
 so I can't say I
 blame ya.

01aa # 
*Oh! You collected ten
 ticket stubs!
\b*All right, then! I'll
 lend you my tank!
\b*Hahaha! You sure seem
 happy to hear that!

01ab # 
*You wrecked my tank.
 My precious, precious
 tank... (weep)
\b*You better pay me the
 money to have it

*The Garricksons' baby

 REALLY weird.

01b4 # 
*Let's see...
 Two plus three is
 five.
\b Eight minus four is
 four...
\b I study all the time.

01b5 # 
*Mommy! I miss you!

01b6 # 
*Daddy! I miss you!

01b7 # 
*A big flying ship
 took all the grownups
 away.

01b8 # 
*It's great having no
 grownups around!
\b (sniffle sob)

01b9 #

01bd # 
*Oh, hello there.
 My name is Tom
 Garrickson.
\b*Introducing myself is
 my hobby.

01be # 
*Mommy told me this
 baby has a special
 power.

01c0 # 
*Gaga googoo.

01c1 # 
*I am this baby's
 consciousness.
\b*I have psychic
 powers, just as you
 do.
\b*I possess the ability
 to teleport.
\b*With it, you can
 return to anywhere
 you've been before.
\b*(The baby's mind
 taught you how to use
 teleportation PSI.)

01c6 # 
*I think I heard the
 voices of my dad and
\b the others coming
 from the mountains.
\b*But the mountains are
 way past the town of
 Valentine.
\b*It's too far away for
 me to go there.

01c7 # 
*Aww, man. I can't
 give it to you.
\b You're holding too
 much stuff.

01c8 # 
*Time has passed,
 but you're still
 underage.

01c9 # 
*You really oughtta
 watch where you're
 walking.
\b*Heheheh...

01ca # 
*Oh, that blasted
 Black Blood Gang...

01cb # 
*"Black Blood Gang" is
 a long name,
\b so everyone just
 calls it the BB Gang.

01cc # 
*You're not with the
 BB Gang, I hope...

01cd # 
*Everything's been
 nuts ever since black
 clouds appeared
 over the mountains.
\b The town and its
 people have all
 started to go crazy.

01ce # 
*Hey! You!
\b*You two, there!
 Are you two
 sweethearts?

01cf # 
*You love each other?
 Hurray!

01d0 # 
*I dunno, are you sure
 love isn't budding
\b deep inside your
 hearts?

01d1 # 
*Hey, I got concert
 tickets.
\b*They cost $%%
01d2 # 
*Here you go!
\b*You're lucky. They're
 all sold out at the
 department store.

01d3 # 
*Geez, you kids are
 cheap.

01d4 # 
*I have some secret
 info you might find
 interesting.
\b*Want to hear it?

01d5 # 
*The BB Gang's boss's
 full name is [teddy]
 Junior the 3rd.
\b*It's only a rumor,
 though.

01d6 # 
*I'm sure you'll
 regret it later.

01d7 # 
*No peeking in the
 dressing room.
\b*You'll wind up in a
 world of trouble if
 you do.

01d9 # 
*You're so cute.
\b*Oh, your name is
 [leader's name]?
\b*Here, this beer's on
 me. Drink up!

01da # 
*Oh, you're still a
 kid?
\b*Come back when you're
 older, then.

01db # 
*Forget it. No more
 drinks from me.

01dc # 
*Now do you regret
 what you did?

01dd # 
*If you promise not to
 do it again, then you
 can go.
\b*But I think I'll hold
 on to your dangerous
 items.

01de # 
*Then you can spend
 another day in there
 to cool off.

01df # 
*Heheheh.
\b*I got my hands on
 some [item]s
 the other day.
\b*Want one for $%%
01e0 # 
*You don't got enough
 money.
\b*Grrrr...

01e1 # 
*[teddy]'s parents
 were killed by
\b monsters in the
 mountains.
\b*He had always been
 such a nice boy
 before then.

01e2 # 
*I wish [teddy] would
 go back to his old,
 gentle self.

01e3 # 
*You gonna sing too?

01e4 # 
*All right! Do
 something with lots
 of pizzaz!

01e5 # 
*I guess you're a shy
 kid, huh?

01e7 # 
*[ana]!
\b*Oh, nothing. I saw
 your name written on
 your hat, that's all.

01e8 # 
*That girl you brought
 with you sure was
 cute.

01e9 # 
*Thanks, that was a
 great song.
\b*Say, are you the guys
 who've been messin'
 with my buddies?

01ea # 
*You're goin' down!

01eb # 
*I know it was you!

01ec # 
*Ahahaha, you're
 really somethin'!
\b*[ninten], was it?
\b*Whadya say we call it
 a draw?
\b*I really wanna avenge
 my parents.
\b*How about we go to
 the mountains
 together?

01ee # 
*Please give my
 [ninten] all the help
 you can.

01ef # 
*[leader's name] used the
 Phone Card.

01f0 # 
*Great! I'm sure we'll
 make a great team of
 punks! Cheers!

01f3 # 
*Please! I know I can
 help you guys!

01f4 # 
*Hello, this is your
 dad.
\b*I don't mean to butt
 in or anything...
\b But what's your
 problem?!
\b*Just press the
 A Button already!

01f5 # 
*Hey, you. Four-eyes.
\b*You're not cut out
 for fightin'.
\b*Rest here and take it
 easy.
\b*I'll take your stuff,
 too.

01f7 # 
*There's no way we can
 beat 'em with brute
 strength alone.
\b*But we CAN bring
 peace back to the
 world.
\b*I just know it.

01f8 # 
*[teddy]: What're you
 two blushin' for?
\b*Let's get goin'
 already!

01f9 # 
*I'm changing my
 clothes! You pervert!

01fa # 
*I'm [lloyd]'s father.
\b*[ninten]'s dad asked
 for your name
 earlier.
\b Did you give him the
 right name?

01fb # 
*Okay, great.
\b*Please keep [lloyd]
 safe, okay?
\b*He IS a weakling,
 after all...

01fc # 
*Then let's go through
 the process again.

01fd # 
*You should visit the
 harbor before you go
\b to Holy Loly
 Mountain.
\b*I really mean it.

01fe # 
*...Have you ever had
 strawberry-flavored
 tofu before?

01ff # 
*If you ever find any
 more, could you bring
 it to me?
\b I'll give you
 something nice in
 return.

0200 # 
*Oh. I wish they'd
 start selling it out
 here...

0201 # 
*Oh, strawberry-
 flavored tofu!
 Thank you!
\b*Now let me give you a
 nice gift in return.

0204 # 
*Stop by if you ever
 get hurt.
\b*It's not much, but I
 have food, medicine,
\b and some plain beds
 here.

0206 # 
*Say, [lloyd].
\b*Looks like it's
 finally time to use
\b what little courage
 you have.

0207 # 
*Hello, kids.
\b*What do you need?

0208 # 
*MY NAME IS EVE.
\b I HAVE BEEN WAITING
 FOR YOU.
\b*MY FATHER WAS GEORGE.
\b HE WAS TAKEN TO THE
 ENDS OF THE UNIVERSE,
\b AND THEN HE RETURNED
 HERE.
\b*MY DUTY IS TO PROTECT
 YOU.

020d # 
*Surely it must be
 hard carrying so much
 stuff...

020e # 
*[ninten]! [ninten]!
\b*It looks like you got
 your head handed to
 you.
\b*So, how about giving
 it another shot?

020f # 
*[ninten] decided to
 return
\b after summoning all
 the courage and
 energy he had.
\b*Good luck, [ninten]!

0210 # 
*[ninten] realized it
 had only been a bad
 dream.
\b*Good luck, [ninten]!

0211 # 
*Give to who?

0212 # 
*That person can't
 carry any more
 stuff.
\b*Give it to someone
 else?

0213 # 
*You still have some
 stuff left here, so
 come get it later.

0214 # 
*Are you a friend of
 [ninten]?
\b*Really? I see.
\b*But these items
 belong to [ninten],
\b so I can't give
 them to anyone
 else.

0215 # 
*Has that weakling
 [lloyd] kicked the
 bucket?

 Welcome to

 Ocean Overlook

0219 # 
*I don't think
 there's anyone here
 by that name,
\b but perhaps I'm
 mistaken...

021a # 
*The grass energized!

021b # 
*There's no one like
 that here!

021c # 
*[item], right?
\b Thanks! I really
 appreciate it!

021d # 
*It is easy to lose
 items in the vicinity
 of this sign,
\b so please be careful.

021e # 
*Incredibly enough,
 you found dentures
 under the sign!

021f # 
*Hi! Need healing?

0220 # 
*Come to the science
 lab.

0222 # 
*The mysterious
 phenomenon has
 stopped, for now...

0223 # 
*Listen closely, now.
 I'm going to explain
 how to use this.
\b*All right. Whatever
 you do, don't
 press...
\b*Oh, crap! I pressed
 it!

0224 # 
*I'll make you some
 [fav food].
\b*Eat some and scoot up
 to bed.

0228 # 
*Oh me, oh my!
  Oh me, oh my!
   Oh me, oh my!
\b*My dear Pippi's
 gotten lost.
\b*If you're going into
 town, please tell the
 mayor for me, okay?
\b (sniffle sniffle sob
 sob)

0229 # 

022a # 
*I'\ll buy it for $%%
022b # 
*[leader's name] took out his
 great-grandfather's
 diary
\b and read these words
 aloud:
\b "...That which was
 left behind
\b by the ship that
 soars the heavens."

022e # 
*You're lying.
\b*I can see right
 through your tricks.

022f # 
*(The audience is
 unhappy.)
\b*You said there'd be
 a trio! There ain't
 three people here!
\b Boo! Boo!

0230 # 
*Which item will you
 leave with me?

0232 # 
*The dragon was in a
 very deep sleep.

0234 # 
*Can I help you?

0236 # 
*Done. Anything else?

0237 # 
*Okay, then. Be
 careful out there.

0238 # 
*Here! Anything else?

0239 # 
*There was a landslide
 up by Santa Claus
 Station,
\b so the train can't
 get through.

023a # 
*The [item], yes?

023b # 
*It looks you can't
 hold any more items.

023d # 
*Oh. You don't seem to
 have enough money.

023e # 
*Oh, my. It looks like
 you can't hold any
 more items.

023f # 
*You don't have enough
 money.
\b*Come back again when
 you do.

0240 # 
*Bye! Take care!

0242 # 
*Oh, my. You can't
 carry any more
 things.
\b*In that case, I'll
 give it to you the
 next time I see you.

0243 # 
*Here you go!
 Medicine!

0244 # 
*Okey-doke!
 Good night!

0246 # 
*WITHDRAW HOW MUCH?

0247 # 
*DEPOSIT HOW MUCH?

0248 # 
*Okay! Let's go back
 to town now!

0249 # 
*Oh, no. It looks like
 you can't carry any
 more items.
\b*That's too bad.

024a # 
*You can't carry any
 more stuff?
\b*That's too bad.

024b # 
*Looks like you can't
 carry any. Come by
 later when you can.

024d # 
*Which course would
 you like?

0250 # 
*I can't talk very
 well without my
 dentures.

0251 # 
*Looks like you still
 don't have enough.

0258 # 
*You seem to be having
 a tough time...
\b I'm so worried...

0259 # 
*Good luck!

025a # 
*Who's your leader?!
\b I'm gonna teach 'im
 a lesson!!

025b # 
*The BB Gang members
 are doing just fine.

025d # 
*Please don't make me
 angry.

025e # 
*[leader's name] secretly
 pocketed it.

025f # 
*Oh, you don't seem to
 have enough money.

0260 # 
*Oh, it looks like you
 can't carry any more
 things.

0261 # 
*I am the professor's
 Assistant A.
\b*I, too, would love to
 try some strawberry-
 flavored tofu.

0262 # 
*Oh, it looks so good!
\b*Thanks, I appreciate
 it.
\b As a token of my
 gratitude,
\b I'll share some
 information I heard.
\b*There's an amazing
 robot at the bottom
\b of a lake on Holy
 Loly Mountain.
\b*I bet it still works,
 too!

0263 # 
*I realize I look like
 Assistant A, but I'm
 actually Assistant B.
\b*I really, truly want
 to try strawberry-
 flavored tofu too.

0264 # 
*Oh! Oh! I'm so happy!
\b*Please, take this
 with you!

  Medicine Sleep

*You can't hold any
 more stuff...
\b*Come get it later,
 then. Don't forget!

0267 # 
*You're here for your
 Big Bag, right?
\b I've been expecting
 you.

0268 # 
*Here, this is for
 you. It's a Big Bag.

0269 # 
*It's no big deal.
\b*The real problem is
 my wife.
\b*She sleeps until noon
 every day and she
\b never packs me a
 lunch.
\b*Isn't that just
 terrible?

026a # 
*Oh! [ana] is dead!

026b # 
*Thank you for
 everything.
\b*As a token of my
 gratitude...
\b I'll be praying for
 your success.

026c # 
*I'm Laura.

0270 # 
*Oh, my! It's [ninten],
 the hero!
\b I never expected you
 to return all
 alone...
\b*Are you taking a
 break?

0271 # 
*Oh, little girl.
\b*This is no place for
 a child like you.

0273 # 
*Oh, [leader's name]!
 How are you doing?

0274 # 
*Good morning. It
 looks like you slept
 well.

0275 # 
*Please come again,
 okay? Promise?

0276 # 
*Good morning!

0277 # 
*Be careful. A lot of
 the monkeys here like
 to lie.

0278 # 
*Heheh. Do I look like
 a monkey?

0279 # 
*...I'm actually a
 tanuki, also known as
 a racoon dog.
\b*I'm in disguise.

027a # 
*Darn.
\b*You have really good
 eyes, you know that?

027b # 
*You should quit
 playing.

027c # 
*Are you really sure
 about that?

027d # 
*Oh. Oh, well, then.

027e # 
*You managed to catch
 me.
\b You're really
 something.
\b*Here's something nice
 for you.

027f # 
*Turn right and then
 left to find
 something nice.

0280 # 
*It seems peaceful in
 here, but it's also
 way too dark.

0281 # 
*Straight!
 Just walk straight!
\b The truth is
 somewhere straight
 ahead.

0282 # 
*I'm a lady, you know.
\b*You shouldn't walk up
 to a lady so casually
 and start talking.
\b Don't you agree?

0283 # 
*Actually, I'm a man.

0285 # 
*La-la la la-la, la la
 la la la...
\b*Oh, don't pay any
 attention to this
 melody.

0286 # 
*How long has it taken
 you to get this far?
\b*Oh, I just thought
 I'd ask.

0287 # 
*I got some good
 information for you.
 You interested?

0288 # 
*Well, basically...
 Treasure your
 friends.
\b*That's all I have to
 say.

0289 # 
*Fine, then!
\b*You have no
 intellectual
 curiousity at all!

028a # 
*Stop! You must not go
 this way!

028b # 
*I don't trust any of
 the monkeys here.
\b All they ever do is
 lie.
\b*Go right, left, left,
 and then right.

028c # 
*Turn back!
\b*Or, if you don't feel
 like turning back,
 then just keep going!

028d # 
*I think you'll meet a
 new friend in a city
 with an ocean view.

028e # 
*I'm a shy monkey.
\b*Talking isn't really
 my thing.
\b*......Okay?
\b*......

028f # 
*Hubba hubba. Heaven
 must be missing an
 angel.

0290 # 
*Don't assume that all
 monkeys are liars.

0291 # 
*I'm the boss monkey.
\b It annoys me how the
 others lie all the
 time.
\b*Go straight ahead and
 you'll find the exit
 to your right.

0292 # 
*Boy, did I mess up...
\b*I must've made a
 serious mistake to
 wind up here.

0293 # 
*Help!

0294 # 
*Oh, the phone!
 Could you get it,
 [ninten]?

0295 # 
*I'm Abbot, the
 mayor...'s assistant.
\b*The mayor is right
 over there.

0296 # 
*I have a secret to
 share with you later.

0297 # 
*Oh, you came to stay
 the night again?

0298 # 
*Oh, a traveler!

0299 # 
*If you think you're
 supposed to bust the
\b ghosts in the haunted
 house...
\b you're gravely
 mistaken.
\b*No, there's actually
 a melody there.

029b # 
*I have faith that
 [ana] is doing well
 somewhere out there.

029c # 
*Hey, you're underage.
 I'm taking you into
 custody.

029f # 
*Say, I heard you
 stepped on a land
 mine.
\b*I stepped in dog crap
 once myself.

02a0 # 
*I heard you stepped
 in dog crap
\b in some place called
 the Advent Desert.
\b*Could you get any
 lamer?!

02a1 # 
 Certificate
\b This hereby certifies

 land mine in the
 Advent Desert.
\b Please keep this
 location a secret

02a2 # 
*It looks like you
 slept well.
\b*Where are you off to
 today?
\b*Well, take care!

02a3 # 
*Oh, you're not here
 to visit someone?
\b*If you are the
 patient, come into
 the back room.

02a4 # 
*We don't have anyone
 named that in our
 hospital.

02a5 # 
*The cold this year is
 especially bad.
\b*It's made me so
 scrawny...

02a6 # 
*I don't have a cold.
\b Cough cough.
\b*Oh, that wasn't a
 cough.
\b It's just something I
 say out of habit.
\b*Cough cough.

02a7 # 
*Exhausted? Go to the
 hotel.
\b*Sleepy? Go to the
 hotel.
\b*That's all there is
 to say, really.

02a8 # 
*Oh, hi. Heh heh.

02a9 # 
*This is a restaurant,
 tra-la-la!
\b*A happy restaurant,
 ha-ha-ha!
\b*Are you feeling
 happy?

02aa # 
*Are restaurant owners
 everywhere so
 musical, I wonder?

02ab # 
*I think [fav food]
 is great, too.

02ac # 
*The hotels around
 here are really no
 different from the
\b ones in Mother's Day,
 yet they cost so much
 more.
\b (mutter grumble)

02ad # 
*This hotel is cheap.
\b*But that's about the
 only thing it has
 going for it.

02ae # 
*There was a landslide
\b and now big rocks are
 blocking the railroad
 tracks.
\b*The train can't get
 through.

02af # 
*You understand animal
 talk, right?
\b*Then I'll give you a
 hint: try checking
 me.
\b*Woof!

02b0 #

 our menu.

02b2 #

 Where's the wine list
 I asked for?

02b8 # 
*I want to try some
 [fav food].

02bb # 
*I'd like to help the
 zombies become
 friendly
\b by teaching them
 about God.
\b*But...
 Zombies freak me out!

02bc # 
*It's me, Pippi!
\b*We really did meet
 again, [leader's name]!
\b*I went out to play
 again.
 That's why I'm here.
\b Don't tell my mom,
 though.

02bd # 
*Oh, aren't you
 [leader's name],
\b that snot-nose kid
 who sat next to me
 in kindergarten?
\b*Or are you someone
 else?

02be # 
*Please don't
 dine-and-dash.
\b Sorry if that comes
 off as distrustful...

02bf # 
*You know, you look
 like you have a big
 appetite.

02c1 # 
*With the tracks
 ruined, the train has
 stopped running.
\b*Quit with all the
 pesky questions, will
 ya?
\b*Geez, you're
 persistent.
\b*You're gonna make me
 cry with all your
 questions.

02c2 # 
*Don't just stand
 there! Get moving!

02c3 # 
*You look like you've
 been through a lot.
\b*Well, now you can sit
 back, relax, and
 regret it all.

02c4 # 
*I've heard about all
 the great things
 you've been up to.
\b*You must really be
 brave, huh?

02c5 # 
*Canary Village is
 north and west of
 here.
\b*You should definitely
 go visit it -
 admission is free!

02c6 # 
*There's this really
 pretty secretary at
 the town hall.
\b*She's the first floor
 receptionist.

02c7 # 
*I'm starving.

02c8 # 
*It's like I told my
 son,
\b "If you have time to
 play Nintendo
 games...
\b then you should be
 studying instead!"

02c9 # 
*You have a really
 cheerful look on your
 face.

02ca # 
*Duncan is trying to
 open a strip club in
 this town.
\b*I'm absolutely
 against it!

02cb # 
*Someday I wanna be a
 doctor so I can help
 people.
\b*And so I can make
 loads of money.

02cc # 
*Huh? Really?
\b This is a respectable
 survey, though...

02cd # 
*Go to school, you!
\b*You're a student,
 aren't you?!

02ce # 
*How are we going to
 get the rocks off the
 train tracks?
\b*If we let city hall
 take care of it,
\b they'll be there well
 into next year!

02cf # 
*I heard there's a
 gigantic rocket in
\b the Duncan Factory
 way up north.

02d0 # 
*Don't assume I'm just
 an ordinary old guy.
\b*Although I actually
 am.

02d1 # 
*You know...
\b*If it were up to
 me...
\b*I'd probably use a
 Duncan Factory rocket
\b to blow up the rocks
 on the tracks.

02d2 # 
*My husband is an
 important man at
 Twinkle Elementary.
\b*He's so important

 packed lunches from
 home.

02d3 # 
*Have you been to the
 Sweet Little Factory?

02d4 # 
*You know how there
 are scary monsters
 all outside town?
\b*I'm worried to death
 that they'll steal my
 money.

02d5 # 
*La-la-laaa...
\b Into the wide blue
 sky...
\b dandelion fuzz does
 fly...
\b La-la-laaa!
\b*I love music more
 than anything else!

02d6 #

 has the key to the
 roof,
\b but he won't give it
 to anyone.

02d7 #

 telling man on top of
\b the mountain is
 really friendly.
\b*He'll give you as
 much stuff as you can
 possibly carry!

02d8 # 
*I walked through the
 tunnel once when I
 was young.
\b*I went to see a dead
 body.

02d9 # 
*This is a residental
 area.
\b Try to keep the noise
 level down when you
 are walking around.

02da # 
*I bet you've thrown
 food into the fields
\b to get rid of it,
 huh?
\b*Well, I guess it
 can't be helped,
\b since this IS a game
 and all.

02db # 
*Whoa...!!!
\b*I'm... doing research
 about baths.
\b*It's for a university
 project.
\b*...It's the truth!
 I swear!

02dc # 
*Man, having a bike
 would be so
 convenient.

02dd # 
*I'm starving...
\b ...Is what you
 expected me to say,
 huh?
\b*Well, don't worry, I
 won't.
\b I AM starving,
 though.

02de # 
*I love the city.
\b*I love the trendy,
 fashionable
 lifestyle.

02df # 
*I don't believe in
 psychic powers at
 all.

02e0 # 
*I'm an overshadowed
 man.
\b*Sometimes it seems
 like I've disappeared
 completely.

02e1 # 
*I love this town.
\b*Halloween, the next
 town over, is scary,
 though.

02e2 # 
*Do you believe in
 God?

02e3 # 
*If you have really
 strong cold medicine,
\b they'll buy it for a
 lot at the store.

02e4 # 
*I'm a cheery mailman,
 la-la-la!
\b*Do you know where the
 Rosemarys moved to,
 la-la-la?

02e5 # 
*The mailman is trying
 to find the Rosemary
 family's new address.
\b*If you see him, tell
 them they live much
 further to the east.
\b*La-la-la!

02e6 # 
*That Rosemary girl
 gives me the creeps!

02e7 # 
*The whole downtown
 area was so full of
 monsters that
\b everyone fled here.

02e8 # 
*Can I help you?

02e9 # 
*I'm a fortuneteller
 in training.
\b*I can see you
 returning to Santa
 Claus Station from
\b this train station.
\b*I'm not 100 percent
 sure about that,
 though.

02ea # 
*[ana] lives in a
 temple... Err, I mean
 a church.
\b*Oh, you already knew
 that?

02eb # 
*There's a church in
 the mountains further
 to the east.
\b*(cough... cough...)

02ec # 
*You kids sure are
 energetic and
 carefree,
\b wearing such light
 clothes out here!
\b (cough... cough...)

02ed # 
*If you run into some
 camel bones in the
 Advent Desert,
\b tell them I say hi.
\b*That camel and I go
 way back.

02ee # 
*I can treat minor
 injuries here.
\b*But if you're sick,
\b you'll need to visit
 an actual hospital,
 okay?

02ef # 
*I bet [lloyd]'ll have
 a computer-related
 job in the future.

02f0 # 
*Shh! Keep quiet in
 the library!
\b*A-a-a-CHOO!

02f1 # 
*Oh, you must be here
 because you heard I'm
\b the world's greatest
 fisherman.
\b*Well, I wouldn't say
 I'm THAT great,
 but...
\b*Oh, how about I tell
 you about some of my
\b great exploits for an
 hour or so?

02f2 # 
*Get outta my face,
 twerps!

02f3 # 
*Hey, you!

02f4 # 
*My HP may be low, but
 I'm gonna give this
 everything I got!

02f5 # 
*In a fight between
 you and me...
\b I'm pretty sure I
 would lose.

02f6 # 
*I'm tough.
\b*But I'm mostly all
 talk.

02f7 # 
*Our boss [teddy]
 could totally beat
 you with just his
\b pinkie if he wanted
 to!

02f8 # 
*Did you make sure to
 read the sign?

02f9 # 
*If you ever come
 across a cactus with
\b a face on it in a
 desert somewhere...
\b ...that would be
 utterly terrifying.

02fa # 
*Talk to the fisherman
 and he'll wind up
\b talking your ears
 off.

02fb # 
*Any first-grader can
 do a cartwheel,
 wouldn't you say?

02fc # 
*Please take this
 elevator up to the
 observation deck.

02fd # 
*I saw smoke rising
 from an island you
\b can see from the
 observation deck.
\b*I wonder if someone
 lives there.
\b*Man, if only I'd
 looked through the
 telescope...

02fe # 
*I can't do a
 cartwheel.

02ff #

 how to carry numbers
 in subtraction.

 strange teacher in
 the science lab?
\b*...Because I did.

 Dragon Quest 4?
\b*I'm still having a
 hard time with the
 third one.
