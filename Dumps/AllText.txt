 studied PSI.
\b*You might find
 something in the
 basement to help.
\b*But, I left the
 Basement Key

\b*Anyhow, son, you
 are my only hope.
\b*It's time for you

\b*Well that's just
 great.
\b*I knew that you
 could fulfill your
 civic duty.
\b*Applause,
 applause...
\b*Now pretty Pippi,
 don't forget...

*Yes, you'll go?
 Great, great
 great!
\b*Now make sure to
 get a Key from my
 assistant, Abbott.

# 0048 #
*This Key will open
 the Zoo's gate.
 Now don't lose it.

# 0049 #

 alive, and surely
 I'll be a hero...
\b*Er, umh, I mean
 you'll be a hero.

 our hero {Leader},
\b*You have tiger

 Want to buy it?

 Come see us again!

*If it's free, do
 you want it?
 Then take it!

# 0053 #
*How's the Canary?

# 0054 #
*I think something
 is controlling
 the animals.

# 0055 #
*Ah... cute pets
 aren't they?

# 0056 #
*Hmmm.

# 0057 #

 Do you have some-

*Thank you for

*Wait...
\b*You just missed
 something very
 important.

# 0061 #
*Where is Laura?...

# 0062 #
*Laura remembered
 her song, and began
 to sing once more.
\b*Did you learn
 the melody?

# 0063 #
*That's no good.

# 0064 #
*The truth is...
 There is power in
 song.

# 0065 #
*Hi! I am Pippi,
 and I'm lost.
\b*What a brave
 boy you are to
 have found me.

# 0066 #
*Don't get so
 swell headed.
 Ha-ha-ha.

# 0067 #
*You're brave. I
 hope we can meet
 again sometime.

# 0068 #
*I'm so happy!  To
 show my gratitude
 take my gift.
\b*This shiny Badge

 trouble...
\b*STAY HOME!!

# 0073 #
*Is that right?
 Trouble searches
 after you?
\b*Hmm, that's too
 bad.

# 0074 #
*Then, you admit I
 have good taste.
\b*Huh?
 You want a cool
 nickname, too?

# 0075 #
*OK, I've got it!
 From now on, you
 are Noodlenoggin!
\b*Sounds pretty
 cool, doesn't it?

# 0076 #

 That's too bad.

# 0077 #
*Hello, there!
 Noodlenoggin
 {Leader}.

# 0078 #
*Have you ever met
 the man who practices
 philosophy?

# 0079 #
*He is so good at
 nicknaming.
\b*He uses such...
 good taste in it.

# 007a #
*In the first
 place, if we
 have not met
\b*we cannot part!

# 007b #
*Have you met a man
 who says, that you
 cannot part,
\b*with someone you
 have not met?

# 007c #
*I tend to think
 the same way, too.

# 007d #
*You should meet
 him.

*I regained my
 strength at Queen
 Mary's fountain.

# 007f #
*The bad thing
 about Queen Mary's
 fountain is...
\b*that it is so far
 away, and so hard
 to find.

# 0080 #
*I am taking this
 broken earring to
 the fountain.
\b*I'll bet it'll
 change into a
 magic earring.

 sound of the

*Queen Mary often
 has nightmares.
\b*As if scolding a
 naughty child,
 she cries out,
\b*"I am scared!
 I am scared!"
\b*And then she
 starts to sing...
 just a little bit.
\b*Then she forgets
 the tune, and
 wakes in a sweat.

 this to Queen Mary?

Should you fight, or
run?
# 0516 #
It seems to have an
important secret.
# 0517 #
It there any way to
defeat him?
# 0518 #
Don't let him stop
and unpack his trunk!
# 0519 #
Somebody ate his
porridge, and he isn't
too happy about it!
# 051a #
Surprised? It really
does exist!
# 051b #
Be careful of its
exhaust if you are
asthmatic.
# 051c #
Hypnotism does not
work on this robot.
# 051d #
Special armor protects
from PSI attack.
# 051e #
It has, the awful
Stone of Origin.
# 051f #
Something like this
should not exist on
the earth...
# 0520 #
Don't let this primate
punk pick on you!
# 0521 #
A face only a mother
could love.
# 0522 #
Watch those eyes!
# 0523 #
No one is in the
driver's seat.
# 0524 #
It has strong
friends.
# 0525 #
Its shell is
unbelievably hard.
# 0526 #
It uses hypnotism.
# 0527 #

# 0528 #
Its quickness is the
source of its pride.
# 0529 #
Watch out for those
pearly whites.
# 052a #
That thief!!
# 052b #
Don't accept his
invitation to dinner.
# 052c #
A walking fuel
supply.
# 052d #
It seems to be
guarding something.
# 052e #
He can be found
on the FBI's
most wanted list.
# 052f #
Maybe he is not
really rotten to
the core.
# 0530 #
A malnourished robot?
# 0531 #
Do not be tricked by
her smile.
# 0532 #
A man from the stars.
# 0533 #
This thing could not
occur naturally
# 0534 #
What evil lab has
manufactured this
mobile brain.
# 0535 #
It uses various PSI
attack.
# 0536 #
It would be nice to
have armor of your
own.
# 0537 #
An animated tree with
suspicious actions.
# 0538 #
He has a short temper,
so be careful.
# 0539 #
He looks like he could
grow flowers in his
hair.
# 053a #
Her refrigerator
shaped body holds a
heart of ice.
# 053b #
A real bad apple,
stay out of his way.
# 053c #
His twisted face
covers his twisted
mind.
# 053d #

# 053e #
Careful, his 'Smash
Hit'is quite
effective.
# 053f #
Watch out for further
sneak attacks.
# 0540 #
Watch your wallet and
count your change,
he's a thief.
# 0541 #
It might not poison,
maybe...
# 0542 #
He who laughs last
laughs best.
# 0543 #
It is quite different
than a pet cat.
# 0544 #
Exterminate with
Insecticide.
# 0545 #
AHH-Choooo!!
# 0546 #
Insecticide is
effective.
# 0547 #
You'll want to try
Insecticide.
# 0548 #
It's poisonous, but
Insecticide works.
# 0549 #
Don't let yourself
get tied up fighting
this guy.
# 054a #
It looks like it
jumped out of a comic
book.
# 054b #
This enemy's face is
the easiest to draw.
# 054c #
If he was a mask,
someone might mistake
your identity.
# 054d #
Just an ordinary
ghost.
# 054e #
Only as big as a
dinner plate.
# 054f #
Life itself is a
puzzle for Mr.Bat.
# 0550 #
He is small, but it is
obvious that he is a
spaceman.
# 0551 #
Hold your nose!
# 0552 #
An evil, caped Zombie.
Beware, his
'Last strike' could
be devastating.
# 0553 #
A big rat, with a tail
this long.
# 0554 #
Shaped like an egg,
but a little tougher.
# 0555 #

# 0556 #
It stares back at
you.
# 0557 #
It hovers in the
air!
# 0558 #

# 0559 #

# 055a #
It's strong poison
was developed in a
laboratory.
# 055b #
Beware of its poison
and Stone of Origin.
# 055c #

# 055d #

# 055e #
Good experience, if it
doesn't run.
# 055f #
It seems that it does
not have any friends.
# 0560 #
His chair was broken,
and he isn't very
happy!
# 0561 #

# 0562 #

# 0563 #

# 0564 #

# 0565 #
Where's that
antidote.
# 0566 #
Poison, poison,
poison.
# 0567 #
If he smiles, don't
smile back.
# 0568 #

# 0569 #
Its father won't even
look at his face.
# 056a #

# 056b #
Beware of its Stone
of Origin.
# 056c #
I wonder if it carries
fleas?
# 056d #
Hypnotism does not
work on the car.
# 056e #
Hypnotism does not
work on this vehicle.
# 056f #
What is going to
happen next, speeding,
reckless driving, or..
# 0570 #
Don't alarm this
ghost, he has
friends!
# 0571 #

# 0572 #
The optometrists
favorite.
# 0573 #
Watch your step,
Dadseyes are every
where.
# 0574 #
Momseyes will spot
you for sure!
# 0575 #

# 0576 #

# 0577 #
It has friends!
# 0578 #

# 0579 #
He only has PK Beam.
# 057a #
As strong as on ox.
# 057b #
Ragged around the
edges, but do not
underestimate it.
# 057c #
The latest in the
product line.
# 057d #
This is as big as a
manhole cover.
# 057e #
Do not be tricked by
her beauty.
# 057f #
It carries, and
likes to use Bombs.
# 0580 #
There is a plenty of
fuel inside.
# 0581 #
She is good at, and
not afraid to use a
strong PSI attack.
# 0582 #
His sole purpose is
to keep travelers
from passing through
the cave.
# 0583 #
It likes to use PK
Freeze.
# 0584 #
If you can beat it,
that is great.
# 0585 #
Not only will it
attack using PSI,
it is a thief!
# 0586 #

# 0587 #
Careful, he knows
'Brain Shock'.
# 0588 #
"It attacks with
bare hands."
# 0589 #
Its marvelous silver
coat glistens and
gleams.
# 058a #
He is absolutely huge!
# 058b #
If you must sleep,
don't borrow his bed!
# 058c #
New and unfortunately,
improved.
# 058d #
The strongest of
the Starmen.
