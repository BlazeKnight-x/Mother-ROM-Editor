 I'm so scared!

 you on a journey so

 you need...

*Come back home
 whenever you want
 more -1-1v.

000e # 
*Hmm, I see.
\b Sounds like it must
 be a poltergeist of
 some sort.
\b*I'm not sure what to
 do about it, either.
\b*But your great-
 grandfather did study
 PSI at one point.
\b*Perhaps there's
 something in the
 basement that could
\b help make sense of
 things.
\b*I know I put the
 basement key
 somewhere...
\b but I can't remember
 where.
\b*Anyway, you're our
 only hope.
\b Now is the time for
 an adventure.
\b Go forth, [ninten]!

\b Pippi and I are

 south, did you?
\b Please tell me you
 didn't!

 amazing.

 not a zombie!
\b ...Are you?

*Oh, yeah? W-w-well...
\b You're a big stupid
 zombie head! Waaaah!
 Eek!

0028 # 
*Are you really a
 human?

 it this far.

002d # 
*ZOMBIE!

*Heheheh...!
 You get to be a
 zombie too!

002f # 
*There must be someone
 controlling the
 dead...

0030 # 
*Not too shabby,
 youngster!

0031 # 
*Are the zombies going
 to take over our town
 too?

0032 # 
*Oh, that's a baby
 canary.
\b Did you find it in
 Canary Village?

0033 # 
*Hmm. You don't say.

0034 # 
*The birds of Canary
 Village do sing such
 lovely songs.

0035 # 
*I really admire the
 man living in Canary
 Village.

0036 # 
*The town mayor is
 looking for someone
 brave to help him.

0037 # 
*I heard a little girl
 got lost in the
 cemetery.
\b I wonder if she's
 been rescued yet...

0038 # 
*Say... You're not
 honestly thinking of
\b going to the
 cemetery, are you?

0039 # 
*I thought you were
 a sensible boy.

003a # 
*Animals have suddenly
 turned violent,
\b and the dead have
 come back as zombies
 to attack us...
\b*What are we supposed
 to do?
\b I'm so scared I can
 hardly breathe...

 when you're hungry,
\b but I bet you could
 also use its crumbs

\b*...I guess it's
 really none of my
 business, though.

*I don't know,
\b this task might be
 too much for you to
 handle,
\b but I still have high
 hopes for you anyway.

0041 # 
*Well, you see...
\b*A child has strayed
 into the cemetery.
\b*And, as luck would
 have it, I'm up for
 re-election soon.
\b*So... please help me!

0042 # 
*Oh! You'll do it?!
\b*You'll go and rescue
 her?!

 the girl who got
 lost?
\b*Stunning work, lad!
\b*I knew from the start
 that you showed
 promise!
\b (clap clap applause)
\b*You're so lucky,

 Adorable, too.

 you certainly do love

\b*Have my assistant
 Abbot give you a key

 the key to the zoo.

\b*You have tiger

\b*Oh, I'm just kidding!
\b*Sorry, I don't have

\b Wahahaha!

\b*Here, have another.

004d # 
*As you can see, all
 our animals have
 escaped.

004e # 
*All we have left is
 this canary chick.
\b Interested in buying
 it?

004f # 
*Then how about for
 $-1-1
0050 # 
*Yeah, I don't blame
 you.
\b It doesn't even know
 any songs.

 good care of it!

 canary doing?

 animals...

 there's a machine
\b on the first floor of
 the department store
 that lets you
\b withdraw cash from
 your bank account,
\b but you need a PTA
 card or something to
 use it.

 ask me.

 baby!
\b*Go take it to her!

0060 # 
*You seem to have
 forgotten something
 important about life.
\b How sad.

0061 # 
*Now where did I last
 see Laura...?

0062 # 
*It sounds like Laura
 the songbird has
 remembered her song.
\b*Have you learned her
 melody, too?

0063 # 
*Well, that's no good.

0064 # 
*In song there is
 strength.
\b True words, indeed.

0065 # 
*I'm Pippi. I'm lost.
 You're really brave,
 huh?

0066 # 
*You're such a
 goofball! Hahaha!

0067 # 
*You're really brave.
 I hope we meet again
 sometime, don't you?

0068 # 
*Oh, I'm so happy!
\b*Here, this badge can
 be a symbol of our
 bond.
\b Take it with you.

 have a special
 someone, huh...

\b*"1Where is the god's

*Happiness won't just
 walk into your life

\b*But neither will
 unhappiness.
\b*Wouldn't you agree?

0072 # 
*So if you don't want
 trouble in your
 life...
\b then you'd best stay
 still and never move
 a muscle.

0073 # 
*Really? Unhappiness
 CAN walk?
\b I had no idea.

0074 # 
*So, you admit I have
 good taste?
\b*Then I take it you
 want a cool nickname,
 too?

0075 # 
*Okay, I got it.
\b*From now on, your
 name will be Stupid
 Face -[leader's name].
\b*It just oozes class.

0076 # 
*Oh, that's too bad.

0077 # 
*Heya, Stupid Face
 -[leader's name]!

0078 # 
*Have you met the guy
 who philosophizes
 about happiness?

0079 # 
*He's a master
 nicknamer. He's got a
 real knack for names.

007a # 
*People cannot part if
 they have not yet
 met.

007b # 
*Have you met a guy
 who talks about how
\b you can't part if you
 haven't met?

007c # 
*I agree with him,
 actually.

007d # 
*You really should
 meet him. You'll be a
 better person for it!

007e # 
*I feel completely
 refreshed after
\b stopping by Queen
 Mary's fountain!

007f # 
*Getting to Queen
 Mary's fountain is
 really tough.
\b Not only is it far
 away, but it's hard
 to find, too.

0080 # 
*I'm going to take
 this broken earring
 to the fountain
\b to turn it into a
 magic earring.

0081 # 
*I feel so relaxed
 just listening to the
\b mysterious sound of
 the fountain.

0082 # 
*Oh, are you lost?
 Just keep going
 south.
\b*Oops, sorry.
\b I thought you were
 looking for a
 restroom.
\b*If you're looking for
 Queen Mary's
 fountain,

\b The monkey can sing,
 the piano - it
 chimes.
\b Though ghosts will
 play out on its
 keyboard sometimes.
\b Each night in the
 desert, the lone
 cactus croons.
\b The dragon, when
 beaten, will carry
 some tunes.
\b While scaling the
 mountain, EVE sings
 along.
\b Will Queen Mary ever
 hear the XX Stone's
 last song?
\b Lalala, what a
 mysterious lullaby.
\b Lullaby, bye-bye, and
 goodbye.
\b*What do you think?
 Nice song, huh?
\b*It is, isn't it?

 for you?

00b6 #

\b*Go think things

 this as soon as I saw
 you...
\b*The train tracks have

\b so the train can run
 through here again.

00bc # 
*Just once, I'd like
 to go inside the
 castle and see what
\b Queen Mary looks
 like.

00bd # 
*Queen Mary often has
 nightmares.
\b*She talks like she's
 punishing a naughty
 child
\b and then cries out
 about being afraid.
\b*Then she starts to
 sing a song, but only
 a short bit of it.
\b*The fact she can't
 remember it seems to
 bring her pain.
\b*Then she wakes up
 covered in sweat.
\b*Something really sad

 You interested?

 Treasure your

\b to blow up the rocks
 on the tracks.

02d2 #

 area.
\b Try to keep the noise
 level down when you
 are walking around.

02da # 
*I bet you've thrown
 food into the fields
\b to get rid of it,
 huh?
\b*Well, I guess it
 can't be helped,
\b since this IS a game

02db #

02e7 # 
*The whole downtown

02e8 # 
*Can I help you?

02e9 # 
*I'm a fortuneteller

 though.

02ea # 
*[ana] lives in a

\b*(cough... cough...)

02ec # 
*You kids sure are
 energetic and
 carefree,
\b wearing such light
 clothes out here!
\b (cough... cough...)

02ed # 
*If you run into some
 camel bones in the
 Advent Desert,
\b tell them I say hi.
\b*That camel and I go
 way back.

02ee # 
*I can treat minor
 injuries here.
\b*But if you're sick,
\b you'll need to visit
 an actual hospital,
 okay?

02ef # 
*I bet [lloyd]'ll have
 a computer-related
 job in the future.

02f0 # 
*Shh! Keep quiet in
 the library!
\b*A-a-a-CHOO!

02f1 # 
*Oh, you must be here
 because you heard I'm
\b the world's greatest
 fisherman.
\b*Well, I wouldn't say
 I'm THAT great,
 but...
\b*Oh, how about I tell
 you about some of my
\b great exploits for an
 hour or so?

02f2 # 
*Get outta my face,
 twerps!

02f3 # 
*Hey, you!

02f4 # 
*My HP may be low, but
 I'm gonna give this
 everything I got!

02f5 # 
*In a fight between
 you and me...
\b I'm pretty sure I
 would lose.

02f6 # 
*I'm tough.
\b*But I'm mostly all
 talk.

02f7 # 
*Our boss -[teddy]

 you with just his
\b pinkie if he wanted
 to!

02f8 # 
*Did you make sure to
 read the sign?

02f9 # 
*If you ever come
 across a cactus with
\b a face on it in a
 desert somewhere...
\b ...that would be
 utterly terrifying.

02fa # 
*Talk to the fisherman
 and he'll wind up
\b talking your ears
 off.

02fb # 
*Any first-grader can
 do a cartwheel,

 [lloyd] returns to a hero's
 welcome at Twinkle
 Elementary School.

0704 # 
Welcome home, [ninten]!
We're so glad you made it
back safe and sound.
You must be famished!

0705 # 
Oh, a letter from [ninten].
I miss him so much.
I hope we can get together
again soon...

0706 # 
Well, now that the Earth's
crisis is finally over, I
think I'll just lie down for
a moment and... Zzzzzzz...

0707 # 
Oh, this is your dad.
I hate to wake you, but it
might be just a little too
soon to rest easy...
