 fa(ll) apart!

# 0003 #
*Waah!

# 0004 #
*Here('s) some juice,
 big brother!

# 0005 #


# 0006 #
*Whew,that was scary.
\b*Oh! I think I see
 something inside the

# 0008 #
*(I')m Mimmie.
 Don('t) mix me up with
 Minnie!

*Are you okay,{Ninten}?
\b*What on earth is
 happening to our

 (I')m so scared(...)
\b*If only your father
 were here now(...)

# 000a #
*You('r)e much braver
 than I ever imagined.
\b*(...)But I can('t) send
 you on a journey so
 famished.

# 000b #
*Oh,my! You('r)e hurt!

 you need(...)

*Come back home

 more {Food}.

# 000e #
*Hmm,I see.
\b Sounds like it must
 be a poltergeist of
 some sort.
*(I')m not sure what to
 do about it,either.
\b*But your great-
 grandfather did study
 PSI at one point.
*Perhaps there('s)
 something in the
 basement that could
 help make sense of
 things.
\b*I know I put the
 key somewhere(...) but I
 can('t) remember where.
*Anyway,you('r)e our
 only hope.
\b Now is the time for
 an adventure.
\b Go forth,{Ninten}!
 Protect us a(ll)!

*(I')ve deposited ${Money Gain}

\b*Your balance should
 be ${Balance}.
 Use it wisely.

# 0016 #
*I realize this isn('t)

 take a little break?

# 0017 #
*I see.Then (I')(ll)
 make a record of
 your progress.

# 0018 #
*I see.We(ll),I guess
 the Earth IS in

*Okay.[repeat -> a00c]
\b*Your dear old dad was

 tight.

# 001c #
*We('r)e a great team,
 aren('t) we?
\b*We(ll),you should turn

 A(ll) right?

# 001d #
*{Ninten},you like to
 work hard,just like
 your mom.
*But,I don('t) think
 it('s) good to work too
 hard.

 Please te(ll) me you
 didn('t)!

\b (...)Are you?

# 0027 #
*Oh,yeah? W-w-we(ll)(...)
\b You('r)e a big stupid

 Eek!

*Are you rea(ll)y a
 human?

 it this far.

*ZOMBIE!

# 002e #
*Heheheh(...)!
 You get to be a
 zombie too!

# 002f #
*There must be someone
 contro(ll)ing the
 dead(...)

# 0030 #
*Not too shabby,
 youngster!

# 0031 #
*Are the zombies going
 to take over our town
 too?

# 0032 #
*Oh,that('s) a baby
 canary.
\b Did you find it in
 Canary Vi(ll)age?

# 0033 #
*Hmm.You don('t) say.

# 0034 #
*The birds of Canary
 Vi(ll)age do sing such
 lovely songs.

# 0035 #
*I rea(ll)y admire the
 man living in Canary
 Vi(ll)age.

# 0036 #
*The town mayor is
 looking for someone
 brave to help him.

# 0037 #
*I heard a little girl
 got lost in the
 cemetery.
 I wonder if she('s)
 been rescued yet(...)

# 0038 #
*Say(...) You('r)e not
 honestly thinking of
\b going to the
 cemetery,are you?

# 0039 #
*I thought you were
 a sensible boy.

# 003a #
*Animals have suddenly
 turned violent,
\b and the dead have
 come back as zombies
 to attack us(...)
\b*What are we supposed
 to do?
\b (I')m so scared I can
 hardly breathe(...)
 (gasp gasp)

# 003b #
*You('r)e so awesome!

# 003c #

# 003d #
*Did a poltergeist
 attack your house?
 It tore mine apart.

# 003e #
*I hear they locked
 the zoo up to keep
\b any more animals from
 escaping.
\b*They've a(ll) gone
 berserk,you see(...)

# 003f #
*Bread is great for
 when you('r)e hungry,
\b but I bet you could
 also use its crumbs
 to mark your trail.
*(...)I guess it('s)
 rea(ll)y none of my
 business,though.

# 0040 #
*I don('t) know,
\b this task might be
 too much for you to
 handle,
 but I sti(ll) have high
 hopes for you anyway.

# 0041 #
*We(ll),you see(...)
\b*A child has strayed
 into the cemetery.
*And,as luck would

 re-election soon.
*So(...) please help me!

# 0042 #
*Oh! You('ll) do it?!
 You('ll) go and rescue
 her?!

# 0043 #
*Oh,is this {Pippi},the
 girl who got lost?
*Stunning work,lad!
*I knew from the start
 that you showed
 promise!
 (clap clap applause)
\b*You('r)e so lucky,
 {Pippi}.
 Adorable,too.
*Now remember to te(ll)
 your mother that the
 mayor rescued you.
*And for you,
 {Leader}(...)
 A ${PRICE} reward.Here.

# 0044 #

 here and everything,
\b won('t) you help with
 the zoo problem too?

# 0047 #
*Oh,you('ll) go check
 it out?
 That('s) wonderful!
 {Leader},
 you certainly do love
 to play games!
*Have my assistant
 Abbot give you a key
 to the zoo.

# 0048 #
*Here you go.This is
 the key to the zoo.

# 0049 #
*Come back alive and
 you('ll) be a hero!
\b*(I')d go with you,but
 (I')m,umm,not feeling
 we(ll)(...)

# 004a #
*Oh,it('s) {Leader},the
 hero!
\b*You have tiger
 droppings a(ll) over
 your clothes,y'know.
*Oh,(I')m just kidding!
\b*Sorry,I don('t) have
 anything to give you
 this time(...)
 Wahahaha!

# 004b #
*Everyone('s) talking

*I have plenty of
 extra zoo keys.
\b*Here,have another.

# 004d #
*As you can see,a(ll)
 our animals have
 escaped.

# 004e #
*A(ll) we have left is
 this canary chick.
\b Interested in buying
 it?

# 004f #
*Then how about for
 ${PRICE}?

# 0050 #
*Yeah,I don('t) blame
 you.
\b It doesn('t) even know
 any songs.

# 0051 #
*Thanks! Take extra
 good care of it!

# 0052 #
*How about for free,
 then? C'mon,take it.

# 0053 #
*Say,how('s) that
 canary doing?

# 0054 #
*(I')m almost certain
 that something is
\b contro(ll)ing a(ll) the
 animals(...)

# 0055 #
*Animals are so cute.
 Don('t) you agree?

# 0056 #
*Teehee.

# 0057 #
*Stupid head!

# 0058 #
*Se(ll) somethin' wi(ll) ya!

# 0059 #
*Something is speaking
 into {Leader}('s) mind.

# 005a #
*Whew,what a relief.

# 005b #
*Thanks! (giggle)
# 005c #
*It('s) nice that
 there('s) a machine
\b on the first floor of
 the department store
 that lets you
\b withdraw cash from
 your bank account,
\b but you need a PTA
 card or something to
 use it.
\b That('s) not very
 convenient,if you
 ask me.

# 005d #

# 005e #
*It('s) such nice
 weather out.
\b But what does it
 matter?

# 005f #
*Oh,that canary is
 Laura the songbird('s)
 baby!
*Go take it to her!

# 0060 #
*You seem to have
 forgotten something
 important about life.
 How sad.

# 0061 #
*Now where did I last
 see Laura(...)?

# 0062 #
*It sounds like Laura
 the songbird has
 remembered her song.
*Have you learned her
 melody,too?

# 0063 #
*We(ll),that('s) no good.

# 0064 #
*In song there is
 strength.
 True words,indeed.

# 0065 #
*(I')m {Pippi}.(I')m lost.
 You('r)e rea(ll)y brave,
 huh?

# 0066 #
*You('r)e such a
 goofba(ll)! Hahaha!

# 0067 #
*You('r)e rea(ll)y brave.
 I hope we meet again
 sometime,don('t) you?

# 0068 #
*Oh,(I')m so happy!
\b*Here,this badge can
 be a symbol of our
 bond.
 Take it with you.

# 0069 #
*I guess you already
 have a special
 someone,huh(...)

# 006a #
*We(ll),I guess this is
 bye for now.
\b*Come by my house
 later to pick up an
 item of mine.
\b*By the way(...) do you
 think my socks are
 too short?

# 006b #

# 006c #
*Oh,you didn('t) have
 to answer.
\b You('r)e such a
 cutie(...)

# 006d #
*Kyakyakya!
 (You('r)e a big doo-doo
 head!)

# 006e #
*{Leader} heard a
 voice(...)
\b*"Where is the god('s)
 tail?"

# 006f #
*Whoa,those are some
 weird clothes you
 have on there.
\b*I bet you('ll) attract
 monsters dressed like
 that!

# 0070 #

# 0071 #
*Happiness won('t) just
 walk into your life
 on its own.
\b*But neither wi(ll)
 unhappiness.
\b*Wouldn('t) you agree?

# 0072 #
*So if you don('t) want
 trouble in your
 life(...)
\b then you'd best stay
 sti(ll) and never move
 a muscle.

# 0073 #
*Rea(ll)y? Unhappiness
 CAN walk?
\b I had no idea.

# 0074 #
*So,you admit I have
 good taste?
\b*Then I take it you
 want a cool nickname,
 too?

# 0075 #
*Okay,I got it.
\b*From now on,your
 name wi(ll) be Stupid
 Face {Leader}.
\b*It just oozes class.

# 0076 #
*Oh,that('s) too bad.

# 0077 #
*Heya,Stupid Face
 {Leader}!

# 0078 #
*Have you met the guy
 who philosophizes
 about happiness?

# 0079 #
*He('s) a master
 nicknamer.He('s) got a
 real knack for names.

# 007a #
*People cannot part if
 they have not yet
 met.

# 007b #
*Have you met a guy
 who talks about how
\b you can('t) part if you
 haven('t) met?

# 007c #
*I agree with him,
 actua(ll)y.

# 007d #
*You rea(ll)y should
 meet him.You('ll) be a
 better person for it!

# 007e #
*I feel completely
 refreshed after
\b stopping by Queen
 Mary('s) fountain!

# 007f #
*Getting to Queen
 Mary('s) fountain is
 rea(ll)y tough.
\b Not only is it far
 away,but it('s) hard
 to find,too.

# 0080 #
*(I')m going to take
 this broken earring
 to the fountain
\b to turn it into a
 magic earring.

# 0081 #
*I feel so relaxed
 just listening to the
\b mysterious sound of
 the fountain.

# 0082 #
*Oh,are you lost?
 Just keep going
 south.
\b*Oops,sorry.
\b I thought you were
 looking for a
 restroom.
\b*If you('r)e looking for
 Queen Mary('s)
 fountain,
\b then just go west
 from the castle.

# 0083 #

# 0084 #
*I bent my spoon,and
 now it('s) hard to eat
 with.
\b*Can you bend it back
 for me?

# 0085 #
*Please hurry.
\b*({Ninten} used the
 power of PSI to fix
 the spoon.)
\b*Thanks!
 (munch munch chomp
 chomp)
\b*Do you wanna stay the
 night here tonight?

# 0086 #
*Why not?!

# 0087 #
*You('r)e very strange,
 you know that?
\b But I also think I
 might like you(...)

# 0088 #
*Great!

# 0089 #
*Waaah! You('r)e
 supposed to accept
 people('s) kindness!

# 008a #
*Oh,a traveler!
 Why don('t) you eat
 with us?
\b*Here,can you guess
 what we('r)e having
 today?

# 008b #
*Huh? Why can('t) you
 te(ll)? You('r)e rea(ll)y
 suspicious!

# 008c #
*That('s) right,
 {Food}.
\b*I read your mind and
 decided to make
 {Food}.
\b*How does it taste?
 Do you like it?

# 008d #

# 008e #

# 008f #
*I used to run a
 musical instrument
 store,
\b but the ocarina I
 ordered never
 arrived.
\b*So (I')ve given up.

# 0090 #
*Oh.I see.

# 0091 #
*Thanks!
\b*Your bed is ready.
 Pleasant dreams!

# 0092 #
*Stop by again
 anytime!

# 0093 #
*You don('t) fit in with
 this place,you know
 that?

# 0094 #
*I finished the
 Ocarina of Hope.
\b*It can play the
 melodies that you
 know.
\b*Do you want it?

# 0095 #

# 0096 #
*Ahahaha.You('r)e a
 real straightforward
 guy.
\b*Here you go.

# 0097 #
*Ahahaha! "I want it!"
 is written a(ll) over
 your face.
\b*Go ahead,take it
 with you.

# 0098 #
*Hi,kid!
 How('s) it going?

# 0099 #
*Leave Magicant?
 That'd be the day!
\b*Ahahaha!

# 009a #
*Outside?
\b What is this
 "outside" you speak
 of?

# 009b #
*(I')m so embarrassed I
 wish I could crawl
 into a hole.
\b*If only there were
 holes to crawl
 into(...)

# 009c #
*(I')m the goods-keeper.
 Want help?

# 009d #
*(I')m great at
 impressions,you
 know!

# 009e #
*There('s) a whole bunch
 of holes east of
 town.
\b*(I')m not sure which
 hole it is,
\b but you can hear
 otherworldly sounds
 coming from one.

# 009f #

# 00a0 #

# 00a1 #
*If you pu(ll) out a
 Red Grass and put it
 in the fountain,
\b it('ll) turn into a
 Magic Herb(...) just
 like magic!

# 00a2 #
*Could I interest you
 in a Big Bag?

# 00a3 #
*In that case,
\b could I borrow your
 ATM Card for a short
 while?

# 00a4 #
*It has 30 Magic Herbs
 inside it,in case
 you didn('t) know.

# 00a5 #
*Thanks.I promise
 (I')(ll) give it back.
\b*It just seems(...)
 rea(ll)y cool.

# 00a6 #
*You don('t) trust
 others.
\b*That might be for the
 best.We(ll),maybe(...)

# 00a7 #
*Oh,right,I need to
 return your ATM Card.

# 00a8 #
*The queen isn('t)
 feeling very we(ll)
 right now(...)

# 00a9 #
*You look suspicious.
\b*But (I')(ll) let you
 through if you can
\b solve my little
 riddle(...)

# 00aa #
*That('s) right.
 The answer is
 "two a(ll)igators".
\b*I haven('t) thought up
 the question yet,
 though.
\b Heheh.

# 00ab #
*Take care!

# 00ac #

# 00ad #
*I wish I could hear
 the queen('s) song
 again(...)

# 00ae #
*Oh,he(ll)o!
\b*I was just in the
 middle of pondering
\b philosophical
 questions.
\b*It('s) hard for me to
 focus with a(ll) this
 guitar music,though.
\b*Oh! Whoops!
\b I didn('t) realize I
 was the one playing
 the guitar!
\b How careless of me!
\b*(...)
\b*This is a secret
 between just you and
 me:
\b come back here when
 you('r)e stronger.
\b*You should probably
 make a note of this
 now so you don('t)
\b forget later.

# 00af #

# 00b0 #
*You tried to ignore
 me,didn('t) you?
\b*I get so lonely,
 being out here a(ll) by
 myself.
\b*If there('s) anything I
 can do,(I')(ll) do it.
\b*Here!

# 00b1 #
*(I')m so happy you
 came!
\b*I know just what you
 want.
\b*Here you go!

# 00b2 #
*I fina(ll)y wrote a
 song!
\b Give it a listen,
 you music-loving
 adventurer!
\b*Oh,baby do(ll),why do
 you weep?
\b*The saddened canary
 won('t) utter a peep.
\b*The monkey can sing,
 the piano - it
 chimes.
 Though ghosts wi(ll)
 play out on its
 keyboard sometimes.
\b*Each night in the
 desert,the lone
 cactus croons.
*The dragon,when
 beaten,wi(ll) carry
 some tunes.
*While scaling the
 mountain,EVE sings
 along.
*Wi(ll) Queen Mary ever
 hear the XX Stone('s)
 last song?
*Lalala,what a
 mysterious lu(ll)aby.
\b Lu(ll)aby,bye-bye,and
 goodbye.
\b*What do you think?
 Nice song,huh?
*It is,isn('t) it?

# 00b3 #
*Deep in the forest is
 a guitar player who
 loves solitude.
*He('s) kind of
 handsome(...) and a
 great poet,too.

# 00b4 #
*(I')ve heard about a
 man who was
 forgotten(...)
*But I forget what his
 story was.

# 00b5 #
*Though you may not
 believe it,(I')m a
 healer.
*I can restore your
 PP or heal friends
 turned to stone.
*So,what can I do
 for you?

# 00b6 #
*(...)That('s) what I
 figured.

# 00b7 #
*Don('t) carry so much
 cash with you.
\b*Go think things
 over.See you later.

# 00b8 #
*(I')m an unsinging
 monkey.
\b*But monkeys don('t)
 norma(ll)y sing,
 anyway.
*Any questions?

# 00b9 #
*(I')m sure it('s) a dumb
 question,too.

# 00ba #
*Whew,what a relief.
\b*I was worried you
 were going to ask me
 something tough.
\b*Say,you look kind of
 like Queen Mary.
\b*I wonder why that is.

# 00bb #
*I wanted to te(ll) you
 this as soon as I saw
 you(...)
\b*The train tracks have
 been fixed,
\b so the train can run
 through here again.

# 00bc #
*Just once,(I')d like
 to go inside the
 castle and see what
\b Queen Mary looks
 like.

# 00bd #
*Queen Mary often has
 nightmares.
\b*She talks like she('s)
 punishing a naughty
 child
\b and then cries out
 about being afraid.
\b*Then she starts to
 sing a song,but only
 a short bit of it.
\b*The fact she can('t)
 remember it seems to
 bring her pain.
\b*Then she wakes up
